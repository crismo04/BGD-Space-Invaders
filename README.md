## PLANED WORK:

- Graphics: Change the player, enemies, and background with open images.
- Sound: Add Shooting SFX, Alien destruction SFX and background music with open sounds.
- UI: 
    - Add number of enemies left and destroyed.
    - Add number of bullets you have.
    - Add number of wishes you have.
    - Add an opening and end game screen.
- Mechanic:
    - add boxes to have bullets.
    - reduce the number of bullets with every shoot (you cant shoot if you dont have bullets).
    - Wish mechanic: some boxes have wishes (another key to use it, and something random happens).
    - winning/losing the game mechanic.
The Wow Factor: wishes.
