## PLANED WORK:

- UI: 
    - Add number of enemies left and destroyed.
    - Add number of bullets you have.
    - Add number of wishes you have.

- Mechanic:
    - add boxes to have bullets.
    - reduce the number of bullets with every shoot (you cant shoot if you dont have bullets).
    - Wish mechanic: some boxes have wishes (another key to use it, and something random happens).
    - winning/losing the game mechanic.
The Wow Factor: wishes.
